This is an AI chatbot made via openAI API which interacts in a conversational way. It was built by setting up tools to install libraries, and finally, creating the AI chatbot from scratch.

Creating this AI chatbot using an API key involves using a programming language or framework to integrate the chatbot with the API. The API key is a unique identifier that allows the chatbot to access the API's data and functionality. Here are the general steps involved in creating an AI chatbot using an API key.



-> The first step in creating an AI chatbot using an API key is to choose an API to integrate with the chatbot.

-> Once the API is chosen we need to create an API key to access its data and functionality.

-> Now we have to choose the programming language and integrate the API using it. This involves using the API's documentation to learn how to access its data and functionality using the API key

-> Now we have to build the chatbot's conversational flow and also train the chatbot for general queries.

-> At last we need to deploy the chatbot and finally test it.
